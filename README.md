# Mpox-Identification-using-Modified-VGG16-Custom-CNN

The project "Monkeypox Detection using Modified VGG16 and Custom CNN" focuses on developing an advanced system for the detection of Monkeypox, a highly contagious viral disease. The project utilizes deep learning techniques, specifically a modified VGG16 model and a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, to analyze and classify medical images for Monkeypox diagnosis.

To lay the groundwork for the project, an extensive literature survey was conducted. This survey explored various research papers and studies related to deep learning applications in medical image analysis and infectious disease detection. By analyzing and synthesizing the existing knowledge in the field, the survey identified relevant techniques, methodologies, and datasets that informed the subsequent development process.

The project's core contribution lies in the modification of the VGG16 model, a widely used deep learning architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. By adopting the VGG16 architecture and fine-tuning its hyperparameters, the project aimed to enhance its performance specifically for Monkeypox detection. This modification process involved adjusting the number and size of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers to optimize the model's ability to learn and extract relevant features from Monkeypox images.

In addition to the modified VGG16 model, a custom CNN architecture was designed and implemented. This architecture was specifically tailored to address the unique characteristics of Monkeypox images and the diagnostic requirements of the disease. By carefully crafting the architecture, incorporating convolutional layers with appropriate filter sizes and strides, pooling layers for dimensionality reduction, and fully connecting layers for classification, the custom CNN aimed to achieve high accuracy and reliable Monkeypox detection.

The project also placed significant emphasis on data preprocessing techniques to ensure the optimal performance of the models. The Monkeypox dataset used for training and evaluation was preprocessed to standardize the image sizes, normalize pixel values, and augment the dataset through techniques such as random rotations, flips, and brightness adjustments. These preprocessing steps were crucial to enhance the robustness and generalization capabilities of the models, allowing them to effectively learn from the available data and perform well on unseen Monkeypox images.

To assess the performance of the modified VGG16 model and custom CNN architecture, comprehensive evaluations were conducted. Various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, were employed to measure the models' ability to correctly classify Monkeypox images. The results of these evaluations provided insights into the effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating the potential of deep learning techniques for accurate Monkeypox detection.

In summary, the project "Monkeypox Detection using Modified VGG16 and Custom CNN" combines advanced deep learning techniques with careful model modification, data preprocessing, and comprehensive evaluations to develop a robust and accurate system for Monkeypox detection. The project's documentation and research paper provides detailed insights into the methodology, implementation, and performance of the models, contributing to the growing body of knowledge in medical image analysis and infectious disease detection.
